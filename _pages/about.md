Hello, my name is Mingze Xia(夏铭泽), I am pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science at [Oregon State University](https://www.uky.edu/){:target="_blank"}. My supervisor is Dr. [Xin Liang](https://lxaltria.github.io/){:target="_blank"}.


I received my B.Math(Hons) in Statistics from the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/math/){:target="_blank"} in 2017 and my Master’s degree in Data Science from [The University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/){:target="_blank"} in 2019. Previously, I worked as a Research Fellow at [Duke Kunshan University](https://www.dukekunshan.edu.cn/){:target="_blank"} and as a Data Scientist at Huawei from 2020 to 2022. My research interests focus on lossy compression, deep learning, and data mining.

<strong>I am currently seeking internship opportunities for [Summer 2026] in both industry and academia.</strong>

**Research Interests**

- Lossy Compression
- Deep Learning
- Data Mining
- Data Visualization

**Paper(s) Under Review**

- 1 * ICDE'26
- 1 * TVCG
