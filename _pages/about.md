Hello, My name is Mingze Xia(夏铭泽), I am pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science at Univeristy of Kentucky.

I received my B.Math(Hons) in Statistics from the University of Waterloo in 2017 and my Master’s degree in Data Science from The University of Melbourne in 2019. Previously, I worked as a Research Fellow at Duke Kunshan University and as a Data Scientist at Huawei from 2020 to 2022. My research interests focus on lossy compression, deep learning, and data mining.

The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.
